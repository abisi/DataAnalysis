Report Intro
In our project, we aim to establish a process that enables the classification of event related potentials (ERPs). The potentials considered are electroencephalogram signals and they are related to one of two distinct stimulation events. In stimulation events, patients observe a cursor moving towards a target. The cursor either continues its path to target or moves erratically in the opposite direction. Therefore, we can consider our two stimulation events defined as: observation of correct cursor trajectory; observation of erroneous cursor trajectory.
The real-world data we use to establish our classification process is comprised of 597 different cursor observation trials. For each trial, we have 16 EEG channels each providing 128 time-relative signal amplitudes, yielding 2â€™048 total features per trial. We also have a binary label for each trial, indicating whether cursor trajectory was correct or erroneous.
To solve this supervised learning problem, we started by exploring the statistic properties of the data. We then tried a variety of feature selection and classification techniques including but not limited to: feature thresholding, k-means clustering, fisher scoring, discriminant analysis, forward feature selection and principle component analysis. 
After considering this array of tentative techniques, we chose to focus on discriminant analysis classifier variants for our final model. To determine on which features to train the classifiers, we tried fisher scoring, forward feature selection and principal component analysis. We used nested cross-validation to evaluate different model-feature combinations.
